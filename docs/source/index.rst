Welcome to a Collection of Tutorials for the Python Package `tropy`
==================================================================
Intro
-----
This is a set of tutorial notebooks which aim to partially describe the functionality of the python package `tropy` which I started to develop at TROPOS since 2011. It contains a rather diverse collection of utility functions for which I did not found an appropriate solution in an existing package. The pyhton landscape has considerably changed - hence some of the tools are somehow outdated, some functions are now covered by established package collections. 

All tutorials are available as jupyter notebooks.

Tools for IO
------------
Function have been written to ease input of certain obervational or model-simulated fields available at TROPOS. These function included data from

* **observations from Meteosat SEVIRI**
  :doc:`with the 'MSevi' class <Meteosat_SEVIRI_data_class>` 
* **observations from the DWD radolan Radar Composite**
  :doc: `with the Radolan class TBD`
